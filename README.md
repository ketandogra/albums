## Albums List

This is a simple React application where albums are fetched from the API and displayed in applications. All CRUD operations are performed on the album API.

Application Preview - https://ketandogra.github.io/albums/

# Features:-
1.Fetch and show albums from the api - https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/albums

2.Add an album, make a POST call to the above url (from where you are fetching), and save the album in the react state. (This will be a dummy request, you wonâ€™t be able to add albums to the server. But the request is valid and will send you some data).

3.Update the album, make a PUT call to the above url. (Again this is a dummy call).

4.Delete an album, make a DELETE call to the above url. (Again this is a dummy call).
